# Experiment Log: Advanced Ensemble Optimization

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal with This Change
**Impact Focus**: Optimize the advanced ensemble system to achieve 98%+ accuracy while reducing inference time by 40% through intelligent model selection, dynamic weighting, and parallel processing improvements.

**Expected Impact**: 
- Higher detection accuracy for production use
- Faster response times for real-time applications
- Better resource utilization and cost efficiency
- More reliable confidence scoring

## ðŸ“š Everything Learned from Existing Code Analysis

### Current Architecture Strengths:
1. **Solid Foundation**: Well-structured modular architecture with `BaseDetector`, `ModelRegistry`, and `EnsembleManager`
2. **Advanced Techniques**: Attention-based merging, temperature scaling, Monte Carlo dropout already implemented
3. **Multiple Models**: EfficientNet-B4 (89.35% AUROC), Xception (96.6% accuracy), F3Net (94.5% AUROC), MesoNet (85-90%)
4. **Production Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, performance monitoring, async processing

### Key Performance Bottlenecks Identified:
1. **Sequential Model Loading**: Models loaded one by one instead of parallel initialization
2. **Fixed Ensemble Weights**: Static weighting doesn't adapt to input characteristics
3. **Redundant Preprocessing**: Each model runs its own preprocessing pipeline
4. **Memory Inefficiency**: All models kept in memory simultaneously
5. **No Model Selection**: Always runs all models regardless of input complexity

### Critical Code Paths:
- **Input**: `upload_routes.py` â†’ `detection_routes.py` â†’ `multi_model_api.py`
- **Processing**: `core_architecture.py` â†’ `advanced_ensemble.py` â†’ individual detectors
- **Output**: `DetectionResult` â†’ database storage â†’ API response

### Performance Metrics Current State:
- **EfficientNet-B4**: 80ms inference, 512MB memory
- **Xception**: 150ms inference, 2GB memory  
- **F3Net**: 120ms inference, 1GB memory
- **Ensemble Total**: ~300ms, 4GB memory
