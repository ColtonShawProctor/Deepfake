This is a placeholder for a real video file.
            
For actual testing, you should replace this with a real video file.
The video should be:
- Format: MP4
- Duration: 10-30 seconds
- Size: Under 50MB
- Content: Real person speaking/interacting

This placeholder file is created because the full video creation requires additional dependencies.
You can manually add real video files to this directory for testing.
